### Alternative Approaches for GitHub:

Since GitHub doesnâ€™t support the `:::code` syntax for embedding code from an external file with specific line ranges, you have a few alternatives:

1. **Manually Copy-Paste Code Snippets**:
   You can copy and paste the relevant code from your file into the Markdown file, just like the example above. This is the most straightforward method on GitHub.

2. **Link to the Code**:
   If you want to reference a file from your repository, you can link directly to it using GitHub's URL structure. For example:

   ```markdown
   You can view the full code in the [StudentsController.cs](./intro/samples/cu/Controllers/StudentsController.cs) file.
